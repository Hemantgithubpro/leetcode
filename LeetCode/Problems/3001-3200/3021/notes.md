# After question done
- did in first attempt
- this question was similar to codeforces and cp

- given n,m so x is [1,n] and y is [1,m].
- initial can be (1,2) or (2,1) then +2 can be done, not +1 or +3

# count
- x is 1 fixed, then y can be [1,m], (1,2),(1,4),(1,6)...(1,m)
- x is 2 fixed, then y can be [1,m], (2,1),(2,3),(2,5)...(2,m)
