
logic:

sorry, this logic was wrong for this question as it had sum, i thought it was product
break 'n' into powers of primes
like
2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d * 11^e * 13^f * 17^g * 19^h
then we can use the formula for number of divisors

i know there is a better way to do this, but i am not sure how to do it

## Did it myself without seeing any solution, WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO!
