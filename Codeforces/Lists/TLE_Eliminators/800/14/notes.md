this a games problem, so i'll use a game theory approach

Game theory in competitive programming involves analyzing strategies and outcomes between players to find optimal moves. Common patterns include:

1. **Winning vs Losing States**: Identify positions that guarantee a win/loss
2. **Optimal Play**: Assume both players play perfectly
3. **State Transitions**: Map how game states change with each move

For this problem, analyze:
- What moves are possible?
- Can you identify winning positions?
- Is there a pattern in optimal moves?


## for this problem
a b c

initially, c is exhausted first, then (a,b) are compared
if a >= b, then a wins
else if b > a, then b wins


Notes: did it in first try.
