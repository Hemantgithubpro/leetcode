### This was a complex/tricky problem.

## Initial Approach
- c should not contain any divisors(denominators), b[i]%c[j]!=0
- so b should contain all divisors of c

## I saw the solution, I know that i would've found the answer myself
- Solution Approach: 
    - c: contains all max element
    - b: rest of the elements
