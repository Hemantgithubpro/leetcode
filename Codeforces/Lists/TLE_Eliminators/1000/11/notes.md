my approach and solution is both correct. I have tested it with multiple test cases and it produces the expected results. but it is the codeforces's problem on test case 14, my output on my system is '6', and answer is also '6', but judges output is '5'. I have no idea why it is giving wrong answer, I have checked my code multiple times and it is correct. I have also checked my code on codechef ide.
