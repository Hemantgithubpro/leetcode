## Method 1
- This method is flawed bcoz i forgot about deleting 
- I just have to make the inverse of the binary string.
- count the number of 1s and 0s.


### Rough
- 111100
rearranging such that initial bits don't match
- 001111

# If i had pen and paper, i would have written it down.

## Method 2 
- I could use unordered map to count the number of 1s and 0s.
- Let's try this method.

# YES! My method works.
