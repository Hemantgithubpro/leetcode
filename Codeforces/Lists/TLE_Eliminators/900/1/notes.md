i've tried on paper also, but its not working, my mind is also frustrated

## From the solution:
i got the approach.
1. Store the eight positions of the knight, from King's position.
2. also do the same from queen's position.
3. Now, we have two lists of positions, one from the king and one from the queen.
4. Now, we can check if the king's position is in the queen's list or not.
count the number of same positions in both lists.
