## Brute Force Solution
- find all possible divisors of `n`, then if there are continous divisors, count them.
- i guess there would be tle.

### Example
40
divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40
count:    1  2  1  2  1  1   1   1          

## My optimal Solution approach
nothing came up

# So I saw the solution
