# properties of xor
1. a ^ a = 0
2. a ^ 0 = a
3. a^b^a=b
4. a^a^a = a

# I've watched the solution
my initial solution was partially correct, but I didn't handle the case of n being odd correctly. my approach was correct for even n, but i should have considered the case of n being odd separately on pen and paper.
